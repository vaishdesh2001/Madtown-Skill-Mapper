Direct supervision by attending physicians and residents. Inpatient activities include rounding on rehabilitation medicine service patients, observing patient therapy sessions, discussing patient cases. Outpatient activities includes seeing clinic patients, participating in procedures like joint injections and fluoroscopic-guided spinal injections, performing electromyography (EMG), discussing patient cases. Evaluate and manage a full spectrum of patients with neurologic and musculoskeletal issues. Exposure to multiple disciplines involved in the rehabilitation process. Inpatient diagnoses commonly encountered include stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, orthopedic injuries, debility, amputations. Outpatient diagnoses commonly encountered include developmental disabilities, spine disorders, chronic pain, arthritis, myofascial pain and fibromyalgia, spasticity, and chronic conditions from prior neurologic injuries. Enroll Info: None</td></tr><tr><td>NEUROL 913    </td><td>COGNITION AND NEUROANATOMY    </td><td>Basic science concepts will be integrated to examine the relationship between neuroanatomy and cognition (e.g., learning and memory, executive function, visual perceptual abilities, etc.). Utilize stroke, epilepsy, dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders from clinical practice to demonstrate the connection between brain structure and cognitive function. Hands on experience in neuropsychological test administration and interpretation will be integrated into learning. Brain imaging correlates for clinical cases will be presented by a clinical neurologist.

Enroll Info: None</td></tr><tr><td>ANTHRO 906    </td><td>METHODS AND HYPOTHESIS-TESTING FOR BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGISTS    </td><td>A detailed overview of field methods for behavioral ecologists, focusing specifically on behavioral and ecological sampling techniques. It addresses the challenging process of situating an empirical study within the context of theoretical paradigms. Enroll Info: None</td></tr><tr><td>MED SC-M 775    </td><td>MIND & MOTION    </td><td>Mind  Motion is a 10-week course that introduces students to core basic science, pathophysiologic, and diagnostic principles requisite for the care and treatment of patients with musculoskeletal, neurologic, and psychiatric presentations and disorders. Basic science concepts include those from the traditional disciplines of cell biology, histology, biochemistry, anatomy, embryology, neuroscience, and behavioral science. There is regular integration of these topics with their pathologic and pathophysiologic counterparts. In addition, there will be integration of content related to other curricular domains, or "threads", that include Patient Care  Communication, Evidence Based Medicine, Health Information Technology, Quality Improvement  Patient Safety, Professionalism, Scientific Inquiry and Public Health. Enroll Info: None</td></tr><tr><td>PHM PRAC 555    </td><td>PHARMACOTHERAPY I    </td><td>Clinical application of medications in the management of various neurologic and psychiatric disease states. Assessment and therapeutic monitoring of drug therapy with emphasis on the concepts of drug selection, monitoring of drug effect and titration of regimen. The content also incorporates issues regarding pharmacokinetics/dynamics, drug interactions, pharmacy practice, and patient counseling. Enroll Info: None</td></tr><tr><td>PHY THER 527    </td><td>FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY: EXAMINATION AND EVALUATION    </td><td>Lab-based course that introduces history taking and physical examination skills germane to assessment of patients with orthopedic and neurologic diagnoses in inpatient and outpatient settings. Introduces clinical decision-making and documentation skills with a focus on examination tests and measures. Labs involve the psychomotor application of exam skills. Outside activities with community partners are an integral part of the course. Enroll Info: None</td></tr><tr><td>PHY ASST 640    </td><td>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY I    </td><td>Emphasizes pharmacotherapeutics relative to disease processes of the neurologic, psychiatric, hematologic/oncologic, ophthalmologic, otolaryngologic, endocrinologic, and dermatologic systems. Antimicrobial and pain management principles will also be addressed.
