<html><body><table><tr><th>course</th><th>name</th><th>description</th></tr><tr><td>COMP SCI 763    </td><td>SECURITY AND PRIVACY FOR DATA SCIENCE    </td><td>Security and privacy concerns in data science. Three core subjects will be considered: Differential privacy and algorithmic fairness; Adversarial machine learning; and Applied cryptography, especially with applications to machine learning. In addition, a selection of more advanced topics will be covered. Possible examples include additional notions of privacy, language-based security, robust optimization. Enroll Info: A firm grasp of probability/statistics (STAT/​MATH  431) is recommended. Previous exposure to at least one of cryptography (COMP SCI/​E C E/​MATH  435), security (COMP SCI 642), and modern machine learning (COMP SCI/​E C E/​M E  539 or 540) is also recommended.</td></tr><tr><td>COMP SCI 435    </td><td>INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY    </td><td>Cryptography is the art and science of transmitting digital information in a secure manner.
